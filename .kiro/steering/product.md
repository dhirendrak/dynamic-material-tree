# Product Overview

This is a dynamic Material Tree component example built with Angular and Angular Material. The application demonstrates how to create an expandable tree structure with lazy-loaded data, featuring:

- Dynamic tree nodes that expand/collapse with loading indicators
- Hierarchical data structure (Fruits/Vegetables with subcategories)
- Asynchronous data loading simulation with progress bars
- Material Design UI components and theming

The project serves as a reference implementation for building dynamic tree components in Angular applications, particularly useful for file explorers, category browsers, or any hierarchical data visualization.
